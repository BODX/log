# What can we learn from (jump ’n run) games?

- If you push for it to happen better be focussed. Only then can you win.
- Be careful. But not too much. Sometimes you need speed and agility not do die. Even if not, being cautious and hesitant, things will take forever.
- You can play with style and presentation. But not when you suck at the game. Get good first, then develop your own style.
- There are always rules
- There are always loopholes
- Co-op is a different game
- It’s a drag if it’s not fun. After all, life is just a game.
