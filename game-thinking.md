# What can we learn from video games?

- If you push for it to happen better be focussed. Only then can you win.
- Be careful. But not too much. Sometimes you need speed and agility not do die. Even if not, being cautious and hesitant, things will take forever.
- You can play with style and presentation. But not when you suck at the game. Get good first, then develop your own style.
- There are always rules. There are always loopholes.
- Don’t play with effervescent assholes
- There is no escaping the cops
- Careful on the elevator
- Enjoy your streak while it lasts
- Flying a helicopter is hard
- Keep some energy for tough times
- Unicorns are bitches
- Monkeys are fun
- Co-op is a different game
- It’s a drag if it’s not fun. After all, life is just a game.
